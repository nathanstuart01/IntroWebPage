  <h2>My Hopes and Dreams for After This Course</h2>
<section class="coursegoalssection">
  <div class="coursegoalsdiv">
    <h3>Develop my own ideas</h3>
    <p class="coursegoalsp">As a person who loves being outside for many of my hobbies,<br>
      I am deeply concerned about the climate and it's future health.</br>
      I think something that will help our climate is to find ways to use less fossil fuels.
      <br>My goal is to develop web applications that enable people to use less gas.</br>

    <h3>Work for a fun startup</h3>
    <p class="coursegoalsp">Being able to "build the plane while flying it" sounds like fun.<br>
    The potential growth and energy of a newly formed company sounds like a great
  coding experience.</br></p>

    <h3>Find a job at an outdoorish company</h3>
    <p class="coursegoalsp">When not inside, I love to be outside.<br>
    My hope is to find a job with a company
    that is in some way related to the outdoors.</br>
    Maybe they will be sympatheic to me coming in late on a powder day.</p>

    <h3>Learn Enough Coding to be a capable web developer</h3>
    <p class="coursegoalsp">By the end of the next 11 weeks, it would be great if I have developed
    sufficient coding knowledge in<br> Ruby, HTML/CSS, Javascript, etc.. to land a web developer job
    and feel confident in my coding abilities walking in on the first day.</br></p>

    <h3>Work within Salt Lake</h3>
    <p class="coursegoalsp">I live in the Sugarhouse area of Salt Lake City.
      I love to not be stuck in traffic.
      I want to work close to my home. <br>Anywhere within 15mins of this area would be great</br> </p>
